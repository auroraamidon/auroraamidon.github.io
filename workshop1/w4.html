  A change in code is a change in priority. In order to act differently, one would need to make the case for something being important 
  than the thing whose place it would be taking. By telling people that something like grammar and formality is just as, if not more, important
  than the casualness with which they speak on social media, they  may attempt to accomplish this. If people want to change a path, they must 
  act on making a stronger case for whatever they are focusing on.
